Code Louisville - Software Development 1 - Final Project

This project is a turn-based combat game contained within the console. The player will first choose their weapon, which effects your overall stats.
Then you will enter a battle with a random enemy, each of which have their own strengths and weaknesses. While in combat you are able to attack or heal yourself.
The choice you make will be reflected in the console. At the end of each battle you have the option to play another round or exit the program. A counter will show 
how many battles you have won.

Controls:

When it is your turn -
Enter "a" to attack
Enter "h" to heal


Features:
1. Master Loop - the player can choose to play again after each battle (Do/While Loop)
2. Create dictionary or list - In this case I have chosen another form of collections, hashtables. 
3. LINQ Query - a linq query is used to organize the enemies by attack power, the results are printed to the console
